In this project, data cleaning, transformation and analysis are carried out.

Through the use of POWER BI application, data was transformed for better utilization and manipulation, modifying titles, extracting year and month into different columns for enhanced manipulation during data analysis. Columns containing unwanted text or hindering readability were cleaned.

During data analysis, I focused on key questions: In which year and how many launches were carried out by different organizations, how many launches were conducted per year overall, how the cost of a space mission has varied over time, in which months it is more common to have launches, and finally, the quantity of launches that were successful, unsuccessful, and those that experienced partial failure.
